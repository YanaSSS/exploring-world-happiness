Data selection, extraction, and engineering - First try
## *Abstract*

My main purpose is to explore the paths for good data cleaning and tyding. 
Together with this, visualizations are made so the data can be more accessible to the reader.
Finally the data is analyzed and t-tests are used for accepting/rejecting of hypothesis/ questions asked about
the correlations between the data sets. 

Hypothesis testing is not done properly. I am currently learning more about it. I would appreciate suggestions and advice 
regarding the project.
